kyle:
- box plots instead of bar charts for the distribution
- they don’t work for the public stuff but they should be working for the reports (alongside the bar charts)
- also output the distribution as a table (a table of the aggregated report)
- add percentages of public vs private comments and people who rated and left feedback (and returning votes)
- weekly comparison: this week vs past week (this period vs last period)
- sentiment score 
- codebook, deductive coding, inductive coding
-
