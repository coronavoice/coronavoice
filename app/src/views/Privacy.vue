This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected at this Site. By using or accessing the Site, you signify your agreement to be bound by our Privacy Policy.

          p We may collect non-personally identifiable information, such as pages viewed, browser type, duration and frequency of visits or other data, and may aggregate any information collected in a manner which does not identify any individual (“Aggregate Information”). Aggregate Information obtained in connection with the Site may be intermingled with and used by us in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Site, including both offline and online sources.

          p As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each website you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as “clickstream data,” can be collected and stored by a website’s server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the website from which you linked to the Site. We may collect and use clickstream data as a form of Aggregate Information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our Site, how visitors navigate throughout the Site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. This information will be used to improve our Site and our services. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous and aggregated, and will not intentionally contain any personal information. We may also use this aggregated data in order to conduct academic research studies. As a result of these academic research studies we may publish the anonymous aggregated data we have outlined.
          p.bold Information Usage:
          p We will only use your personal information as described below, unless you have specifically consented to another type of use, either at the time the personal information is collected from you or through some other form of consent from you or notification to you.
